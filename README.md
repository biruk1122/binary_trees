Binary trees
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and nodes with no children are called leaves. The nodes in a binary tree are connected by edges, and each edge is a connection between a parent node and its child node.

The structure of a binary tree ensures that each node has a maximum of two children, and the left child is typically used to represent values less than the parent node, while the right child represents values greater than the parent node. This property makes binary trees suitable for various applications, including search operations, sorting, and representing hierarchical relationships.

There are different types of binary trees, such as binary search trees (BST), AVL trees (self-balancing binary search trees), and heap trees. Each type has its own specific rules and properties that govern the organization and behavior of the tree.

Here's a simple example of a binary tree:
     5
    / \
   3   8
  / \   \
 1   4   10
In this example, 5 is the root node, 3 and 8 are its children, and so on. The binary tree maintains the order property, where the left child of a node contains values smaller than the node, and the right child contains values greater than the node.
